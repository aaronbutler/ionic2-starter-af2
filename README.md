# ionic2-starter-af2
This is a starter template for [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/aaronbutler/ionic2-starter-af2).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

ionic-starter-af2 currently exists only on my github page, so it is best used this way:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myIonicAngularFire https://github.com/aaronbutler/ionic2-starter-af2 --v2
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myIonicAngularFire` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.

or

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

### Prerequisites

1. Ionic cli v.2.1.18 or greater
2. Probably requires a minimum version of node
3. You have to make your own Firebase database
4. YOU MUST ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING DAMAGE/SECURITY HOLES/RISING SEA WATER/POPULIST REVOLTS IN ORDER TO USE THIS STARTER

### THIEVERY
1. I based this starter template on the [ionic2-starter-blank](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter-blank) template. If that was verboten, sorry. Let me know and I will atone.
2. I included the MIT license because I almost understand it. Basically, any rights which I have, I give to you, provided you don't refuse those rights to anybody else for any reason.
